# LpNewFront

This is frontend tool for creating and recording tracks.

All tracks are excerpts from improvised micro-live sessions performed using self-written software based on the library that wraps Browser Web Audio.

Every track is a result of program's live interpretation of commands written as JSON-strings and reflects certain stage of application's development.
